## What is Jules?

**[Jules](https://jules.google)** is a remote AI coding agent from [Google Labs](https://labs.google) powered by Gemini 3 Pro. It works autonomously in a cloud VM—analyzing your codebase, implementing features, fixing bugs, and creating pull requests while you focus on what matters.

**This action** lets you trigger Jules from any GitHub event: issues, pull requests, schedules, or workflow dispatches.

Check out our [example workflows](#🚀-example-workflows) for ideas on using Jules workflows to automatically fix bugs, improve performance, and more!

## ✨ Quick Start

### 1. Get a Jules API Key

1. Authenticate with GitHub at [jules.google.com](https://jules.google.com)
2. Generate an API key from your account settings
3. See [API docs](https://jules.google/docs/api/reference/) for details

### 2. Add to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **New repository secret**
3. Name: `JULES_API_KEY`, Value: your key

### 3. Create a Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/security-agent.yml`:

```yaml
name: Daily Security Scan

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Every day at 6 AM
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: google-labs-code/jules-invoke@v1
        with:
          prompt: |
            You are a security agent. Scan for vulnerabilities and fix them:

            CRITICAL (fix immediately):
            - Hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords
            - SQL injection, command injection
            - Missing auth on sensitive endpoints

            HIGH PRIORITY:
            - XSS, CSRF vulnerabilities
            - Insecure direct object references
            - Missing input validation

            Rules:
            - Fix highest severity first
            - Keep changes under 100 lines
            - Run tests before creating PR
          jules_api_key: ${{ secrets.JULES_API_KEY }}
```

Your repo now has a security agent hunting vulnerabilities daily! 🛡️

## 🚀 Example Workflows

Copy these into `.github/workflows/` and customize:

| Example | Trigger | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [weekly-cleanup](./examples/weekly-cleanup.yml) | Scheduled (cron) | Automated code maintenance and refactoring |
| [performance-improver](./examples/performance-improver.yml) | Scheduled (daily) | ⚡ Hunt and fix performance bottlenecks |
| [bug-fixer](./examples/bug-fixer.yml) | Issue labeled `bug` | Diagnose and fix bugs (or implement features) with structured prompts |
| [ci-failure-fix](./examples/ci-failure-fix.yml) | CI workflow fails | Automatically fix failed builds |
| [unblocked-issues](./examples/unblocked-issues.yml) | Issue closed | Work on issues that were blocked by the closed issue |

See [examples/README.md](./examples/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## 💡 Writing Good Prompts

Jules excels when you give it **clear specifications** or **measurable targets** it can verify. This is especially powerful for scheduled workflows that run continuously.

**Example: Weekly Performance Agent**

```yaml
name: Performance Improvement Agent
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 3 AM

jobs:
  optimize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: google-labs-code/jules-invoke@v1
        with:
          prompt: |
            You are a performance improvement agent. Run our benchmark suite
            and look for optimization opportunities:

            1. Run `npm run bench` to get current metrics
            2. Identify the slowest endpoints or functions
            3. Implement optimizations (caching, query improvements, algorithm changes)
            4. Re-run benchmarks to verify improvement
            5. Only open a PR if you achieve measurable gains

            Constraints:
            - Don't change public API contracts
            - All existing tests must pass
          jules_api_key: ${{ secrets.JULES_API_KEY }}
```

**Why this works:** Jules can run benchmarks, iterate on solutions, and verify its own success. Give Jules a target it can measure, and it becomes a continuous improvement loop.

**More ideas for scheduled agents:**
- Security audit agent (run `npm audit`, fix vulnerabilities)
- Dependency updater (update deps, run tests, PR if green)
- Docs updater agent (update docs based on recent changes)
- Test coverage improver (find gaps, add tests, target 90%)

## 🔐 Security

**⚠️ Important:** Issue-triggered workflows can be exploited by untrusted users opening issues. Always restrict who can trigger Jules for sources like GitHub issues. For things like issues, oftentimes __anyone__ can create an issue so it can be handy to have an allowlist condition for
Jules triggering.

**Add an allowlist condition to your step:**

```yaml
- name: Invoke Jules
  # Only runs if user is in the allowlist
  if: ${{ contains(fromJSON('["trusted-user", "another-user"]'), github.event.issue.user.login) }}
  uses: google-labs-code/jules-invoke@v1
  with:
    prompt: ...
```

**Best practices:**
- Never commit `JULES_API_KEY`—always use [GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
- Treat Jules like any team member: review its PRs before merging
